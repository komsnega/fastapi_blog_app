FastAPI blog app with 3 tables (users, posts, votes) in Postgresql db.
Incomplete exercise in line with course ["Python API Development - Comprehensive Course for Beginners"]([url](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t=47845s)https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0sOvCWFmrtA&t=47845s).
Stopped at 11:34:39 "Heroku intro" since due to the sanctions I didn't have valid card to pay neither for Heroku nor for Digital Ocean discussed later on the course. 
The app was deployed for free on render.com: https://fastapi-blog-app.onrender.com/docs
